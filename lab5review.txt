Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;     -- < notice the correct indentation here


6. Show the names of customers and agents living in the same city, along 
   with the name of the shared city, regardless of whether or not the 
   customer has ever placed an order with that agent.

Incorrect output
- Join is incorrect


7. Show the name and city of customers who live in the city that makes the 
   fewest different kinds of products. (Hint: Use count and group by on 
   the Products table.)

Correct output
- This one could have been done without joins. 
Query is hard to read. Please format your query for better reading.
- Please indent all your subqueries.




In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
